# BouncingBall

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/UnaRagazza/pen/VwxgKvE](https://codepen.io/UnaRagazza/pen/VwxgKvE).

The aim of the game is that the ring needs to catch all the balls. There is a counter in the upper right corner that shows how many balls are left.  
The ring can move using A,W,S,D keys.
